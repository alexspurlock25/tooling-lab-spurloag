## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 
9/10

I did not do the very last part on Cypress section.

## Self-Reflection:
This was less fun for me. After going through this process, I remembered why I don't like modern web development very much and the reason why I would go with native mobile development or backend. Way too much configuration, way too much to consider. It's a lot. Its's not simply creating buttons or other UI. I would not mind it at all, to be honest, if it was less cumbersome and more established.

### How long it took me to finish this?
